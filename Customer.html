<p>Correlation Coefficient HeatMap:
    First I look to see how correlated our Variable are using the Coefficent Correlation Heatmap:
    Correlation Coefficent Values Tell us that:<br>
    - Strong Relationship (.5-1.0)<br>
    - Moderatly Strong(.3-.5)<br>
     - Weak Relatoinship(0-.3)</p>
     <img src="images/reg.png" alt="" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
<p>The investigation of the relationship resulted in the development of a hypothesis: An increase in living Space will subsequently increase the Total Rent There is a moderately positive relationship for .52 . In an attempt to analyze the correlation, We see there is a linear trend for the relationship of Total Rent and Living Space</p>
