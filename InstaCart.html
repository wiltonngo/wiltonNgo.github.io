<h3>They also want to know whether they are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, this might inform the types of products they advertise at these times</h3>
<p>The most expensive items are at Midnight and 6 pm because there are not a lot of people ordering in the morning. So the peak is 6 pm to 10 pm prices started to drop when people order the most since that is when they have free time and off at work Best time to Advertise is at night Friday and Saturday is when people order the most expensive items in preparation for weekend activities.
