    <li>Additional analysis should be done on what films people are really into watching and what kind of genre people like. It is possible from the existing data. We would need to find the revenue that each genre that the country brought in.</li>
    <li>We should focus on countries that bring in more $$ for each customer like Taiwan and the Philippines. So we could earn more revenue.</li>
    <li>RRemove the Films with the lowest Revenue and add films that can earn more revenue by potential. By looking at the revenue for each country Genre they bring in.
